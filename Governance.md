# **Extensioneers Guild Governance**


# **üåê Introduction**

_This governance document specifies how the Extensioneers Guild is organized, operated and governed. The Guild governance aims to give individual members autonomy and ownership, while acting in the interest of all members._

_The Guild‚Äôs main unit of operation and decision-making is the_ **_Circle_**_. There is one circle for each of the Guild‚Äôs_ **_distinct purposes_**_, also called missions. Each circle is self-managed and largely autonomous. It may have many members or only one. The number of Circles, and their members and activities, are allowed to vary over time. This is a feature. Each circle represents itself to the Guild via its_ **_Secretary_**_. Members are encouraged to take part in any Circle to whose mission they wish to contribute._

**_Divisions_** _group circles by mission theme. Each division has two_ **_Coordinators._** _Together, Coordinators form the_ **_Council_**_._

_Decisions should be taken at the_ **_localmost level_** _applicable ‚Äì primarily in Circles ‚Äì following the principle of subsidiarity._

_The Guild is not a monolith to be nudged. It is a dynamic platform through which you, together with your fellow members, may envision a better future, and make it real._

# **Governance Form**

****


## **‚≠ï Circles**

The Guild‚Äôs main unit of **operation** and decision-making is the **Circle.** Each circle is **self-organizing** and **autonomous**.

Members are encouraged to **join any circle** to which they wish to contribute. A member may choose to join many circles, or none.

Some circles may last as long as the Guild. Others may be created e.g. for a specific event, and last only for a short while.

****


### **Missions and Tasks**

Each circle must have its own clear and distinct **purpose**, also called **mission.** Circles should be set up such that each mission is specific to one circle only. This mitigates overlap.

Each circle must have a defined set of **responsibilities** over which it is sovereign. Each responsibility should have a clear **scope of action** that corresponds to the mission.

Each circle performs **tasks** that help fulfill its purpose.

Within each Circle, members are **sovereign**. When making decisions within their own mission, members do not generally need to refer to Division Coordinators or the Council.

There are two exceptions:

- The **budget** of each Circle is allocated by its Division Coordinators. Circle members then decide how to spend it.

- **Member assignment** to a Circle is ratified by its Division Coordinators. Within each circle, roles are assigned to members by election within the Circle.

When needing guidance or advice, Circles may consult its Division Coordinators, the Council, or the Assembly.

Circle members may delegate any decision to the Guild by calling for an **Assembly vote**.

Before a new circle is created, the Division coordinator must **ratify** it and its **secretary**. Closing and combining circles must also be ratified by the Division coordinator.

Members are encouraged to suggest useful new circles to the coordinator.

****


### **Circle Roles**

**Roles** enable circles to fulfill their mission.

The only mandatory circle role is the **Secretary**.

A circle member may have one role, several roles, or none. Each circle assigns roles by election.

Each circle is encouraged to create and assign new roles according to its needs. Common roles include:

- **Secretary**\
  Every circle must have one Secretary. The secretary is responsible for **organizing circle meetings** and for **representing** the Circle to the Guild. The secretary is also responsible for taking meeting **notes** and for implementing guidelines decided by the Council.

- **Facilitator**\
  A facilitator role is not mandatory, but encouraged for circles with 5 or more members. The Facilitator is responsible for promoting, internally in the circle, the democratic expression of each circle member‚Äôs ideas and feelings, while ensuring respect for the decision-making process.

****


## **üóÇÔ∏è Divisions**

The Guild organizes all circles into overarching **Divisions**.

All circles within a division should share a common **mission theme**. A division may have many circles or few.

Since divisions are general containers for circles, divisions ought to be kept few in number and more static in nature.

****


### **Division Coordinators**

Each division must have **two** **Coordinators**.

Each division‚Äôs Coordinator duo is responsible for:

- Organizing its division into circles, for which it proposes the name, purpose, and scope.

- Facilitating circle cross-communication and coordinating circle tasks with Circle Secretaries.

- Being its division‚Äôs delegate and spokesperson in Council Meetings.

- Organizing meetings for discussing its division's budget and strategy.

- Helping members who wish to get involved to enter, or to create, the appropriate circle.

- Keeping division indicators up to date.

Coordinators are elected, in the General Assembly, for a period of **one year**.

****


## **üè† Council**

Collectively, all division coordinators form the **Council.**

The Council coordinates divisions in order to fulfill the Guild‚Äôs purpose.

The Council represents and makes decisions for the Guild in questions **beyond the scope of any one division**.

The Council is responsible for:

- **Coordinating** and **harmonizing** all divisions and circles with each other. This is done in Council Meetings. Here, all divisions are represented by their coordinators.

- Sharing information to keep the different Guild branches up to date.

- Allocating a **budget** to each division.

- Suggest and help implement solutions to issues that go beyond the scope of a single division.

Circles are sovereign. This means that the Council does not dictate any decision made within a Circle. However, the Council has the right to **veto** individual decisions made by circles. Vetoing should be used only exceptionally and by solid motivation. If the Council vetoes a decision, it should be discussed in the next Assembly.

****


## **üèõÔ∏è Assembly**

The general **Assembly** meeting is the Guild‚Äôs highest decision-making body.

For each assembly, organizers **must invite all** members to participate, in writing.

In the assembly, members are encouraged to voice their opinions, concerns, and ideas.

Being a direct expression of the opinion of all members, an assembly vote will **overrule** any decision made by the Council, Coordinators, or Circle members.

Assemblies should normally be held monthly. Assembly invitations should be sent in good time.

Operations coordinators organize assemblies.

****


## **üôãÔ∏è Decision-making**

Voting can be done in a Circle, a Division, a Council or an Assembly.

The Guild follows the **subsidiarity** principle. It states that decisions should be taken at the localmost level relevant for resolving the specific question at hand. [Further details here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity)

In practice, this means that most decision-making is done in Circles. Some decisions, however, concern primarily a larger body of members ‚Äì a division or the entire Guild ‚Äì and by the same principle, their vote ought to be taken at that corresponding level.

The member calling for the vote may also suggest the appropriate voting system for the vote, e.g.:

- **Approval voting**\
  Voters may select **multiple options** instead of only one. The option with the most votes wins. This simple voting system is appropriate in most voting situations having 2 or more options. [Further details here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting)

- **Majority Judgment**\
  Voters **grade** all options based on a predefined set of grades; e.g. excellent, good, passable, bad). This system allows voters to express their opinion finely. This voting system is appropriate when there are several similar options; e.g. choosing a name, a slogan, a service, etc. [Further details here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_judgment)

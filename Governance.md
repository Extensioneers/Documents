# Extensioneers Guild Governance

_The Guild strives to be an agile and efficient organization, structured by thematic divisions with operational circles, and relying on each individual member‚Äôs autonomy._

The structure of the Guild enables members to have a sense of ownership regarding their tasks and missions. This ensures the commitment and accountability of members, while allowing a democratic, fair, and horizontal basis.

## üè¢ Divisions

The Guild is organized into divisions.

Each division is composed of interdependent and self-organizing operational Circles, each with their own mission and tasks.

### Division Coordinators

Each division has two Coordinators. They are automatically part of the Guild‚Äôs Council. They are elected for a period of one year during a General Assembly Meeting.

The division coordination duo is responsible for:

- Being the delegate and spokesperson of their division during the Council Coordination Meetings
- Proposing to their division the spaces and times for discussion/proposals necessary for the development of the division's strategic and budgetary orientations, as well as an effective organization in Circles, for which it proposes the scope, purpose, and responsibilities
- Keeping the division‚Äôs indicators up to date
- Allocating members who want to get involved in it between the different Circles
- Coordinate the Circles in their division together with the Circle coordinators

## ‚ö™ Circles

A Circle is focused on a specific mission/task, or a set of related missions/tasks.
**Circles are independent and self-organized.**

Members are sovereign in their Circles. They do not need to refer to the Council or Division Coordinators when making most decisions related to achieving their mission, although they can seek advice or guidance from the Council or Division Coordinators when needed.
There are two exceptions:

- The budget of a Circle is allocated by the Division Coordinators. Members of the Circle then decide how that budget is spent.
- Members are assigned to a Circle by the Division Coordinators. Roles are assigned to members by election within the Circle.

Circle members can also delegate the decision-making to the whole Guild by calling for a vote during a General Assembly Meeting.

The Circle brings together several roles that contribute to enabling the Circle to achieve its mission.
Within the Circles, each member is responsible for one or more roles, with a defined scope of action over which they are sovereign.

## üë§ Roles

Each Circle can have different or unique roles specific to that one Circle, depending on its needs.
One member can fulfill several roles.
Roles are assigned by election within the Circle.

Among these roles, there are 4 structural roles represented in all Circles:

- **Circle Coordinator**: responsible for implementing the general guidelines decided by the Council or Division Coordinators within a thematic Circle
- **Spokesperson**: represents the members of their Circle and ensures that their voices are taken into account in the overall strategy
- **Secretary**: responsible for the proper organization of Circle Meetings and keeping the Circle's IT tools up to date, taking notes, etc
- **Facilitator** (needed if the Circle has more than 4 members): promotes the expression of everyone's ideas and feelings while ensuring respect for decision-making processes

## üèõÔ∏è Council

The Council is composed of the coordinators of all divisions. It coordinates the different divisions of the Guild in order to fulfill the Guild‚Äôs purpose.

The Council is the decision maker of last resort for everything that goes beyond the scope of each Circle.

Members are sovereign in their Circles, which means the Council doesn‚Äôt dictate the decisions made within Circles. But the Council can exceptionally veto decisions made by Circle members. This veto power is not the decision-making usual process, and should only be used in exceptional circumstances. When the Council uses its veto, the issue is discussed during the next General Assembly Meeting.

The Council is responsible for:

- Coordinate and harmonize all divisions with each other through Council Coordination Meetings: a space where all divisions are represented by their division coordinator. Council Coordination Meetings are organized by the Operations Division coordinators.
- Share information to keep the different organs of the Guild on the same level.
- Allocate a budget to each division.
- Bring proposals for solutions and suggestions to issues that go beyond the scope of a single division.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è General Assembly Meetings

General Assembly Meetings are monthly meetings during which all the Guild members can participate. It is a place where members can freely voice their opinions, ideas, and concerns.
All members are invited, not just members actively participating in Circles.

By being a direct expression of the opinion of all members, a General Assembly Meeting vote can overrule any decision made by the Council, Division Coordinators, or Circle members.
Such a vote needs to be notified to all members at least 48 hours before the General Assembly Meeting.

General Assembly Meetings are organized by the Operations Division coordinators.

## üó≥Ô∏è Voting

Voting can be used at different levels in the Guild: when electing Division Coordinators or polling for the opinions of all members during General Assembly Meetings, among Division Coordinators during Council Coordination Meetings, among Circle members during Circle Meetings, etc.

The member calling for a vote chooses the appropriate voting system for the vote:

- Approval voting: voters can select multiple options/candidates instead of selecting only one option/candidate. The option(s)/candidate(s) with the most votes wins. [More info here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting) \
  This voting system is simple and appropriate for most votes.
- Majority Judgement: voters are asked to grade all options/candidates based on a set of predefined grades (e.g. excellent/very good/good/passable/inadequate/mediocre/bad). This system allows voters to express their opinion finely. [More info here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_judgment) \
  This voting system should be used when there are a lot of similar options/candidates (e.g. choosing a name, a slogan, a service, etc).
